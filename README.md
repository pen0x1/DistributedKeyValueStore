DistributedKeyValueStore is a Rust-based application designed to facilitate the storage, retrieval, and management of key-value pairs across a distributed network architecture. This project initializes both server and client configurations, seamlessly starting the necessary processes to enable robust, scalable, and efficient data handling. Ideal for developers looking to explore or implement distributed systems, this repository offers a hands-on approach to understanding and leveraging distributed computing principles for key-value storage solutions.
